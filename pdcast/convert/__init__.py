to_decimal()
    Decimal-specific version of cast().

to_datetime()
    Datetime-specific version of cast().

to_timedelta()
    Timedelta-specific version of cast().

to_string()
    String-specific version of cast().

Classes
-------
SeriesWrapper
    A a type-aware view into a pandas Series that automatically handles missing
    values, non-unique indices, and other common problems, as well as offering
    convenience methods for conversions and ``@dispatch`` methods.
